# Sample 2: Technical Writing Curriculum Documentation and Breakdown
This document will do two things: showcases my ability to use Markdown and Github, breakdown the tech writing process to creating curriculum documentation.

In 2018 I was asked to create a Technical and Professional Writing course for engineers and computer scientists that satisfied all parties:
* School of Sciences and Humanities
  * Teaching and learning committee
  * Writing Center Director
* School of Engineering and Digital Sciences
* Technical and professional writing theory
* Kazakhstani students
* [ABET](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/accreditation-criteria/criteria-for-accrediting-engineering-programs-2023-2024/) accreditation 

After a lot of reading of scholarly texts, interviewing SMEs, looking at other tech writing curricula, and conducting my own primary academic research, I settled on these **Learning Outcomes**:  
>1. Identify and understand the structures and functions of primary genres of technical writing.  
>2. Analyze and adapt to the constraints of specific rhetorical situations, including audiences, purposes, modality, and use.  
>3. Integrate tables, figures, and other images into documents.  
>4. Individually and collaboratively produce and present technical documents, including research reports, that are accessible to non-specialist audiences.  
>5. Demonstrate the ethical use of sources and appropriate citation conventions.  

Once these are approved by the Teaching and Learning Committee, they cannot be change without further approval. Likewise, each assignment, assessments and policy needed to fit these outcomes as they would lay our course foundation.
* _ABET_ accreditation requires ethnics and writing (LO 5), 
* chemistry students are required to write to non-specialist audiences (LO 4), 
* engineering faculty wanted students to be able to better integrate tables and figures into documents (LO 3), 
* and a lot of the technical writing theory is about the rhetorical situation (LO 2), 
  * including audience, 
  * purposes, 
  * modality, 
  * and use.
Therefore, these **LO**s worked well. 

We decided weâ€™d start small and work out way up to the larger assignments. Here is all our course summative assessments, what they are worth, a description, and when they are due. 

| Assignment                        | %    | Description                                   | Due   |   
| :---                              |:----:| :---                                          |:---   |
| Participation and Preparedness    | 10%  | Daily assessment may include: Writing tasks such as drafts, group discussions and workshops such as peer review, online assignments such as reading posts, quizzes, demonstrated preparedness for each class.                 |Cont.|
| Email and Memo                    | 10%  | Emails and Memos will be required within a specific rhetorical context  |W2, W9|
| Job Application Package           | 15% | An application package that includes a cover letter and resume. Students must create this package for a specific rhetorical situation.      |W4|
| Technical Instructions            | 15% |  Students must plan and write out a technical document, which describes a process they are familiar with. They will list out this process in no more than 12 steps using text and illustrations. The final (first) draft will count for 10%. The other 5% of this grade is for the revision writing process (second). (Collaborative)    |W6, W7|
| Usability Test and Presentation   | 15% |  Students must conduct a usability test on their technical instructions and create a digital presentation on the outcome (Collaborative).    |W7|
| IMRaDR Report                     | 35% |  Students will write reports on their field of interest and conduct the necessary primary research in the IMRaD genre (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) as well as provide recommendations on the issue/problem they choose. Recommend report front and back matter is also required. 10% of this grade is for the writing process: drafts, peer review, workshops, etc. The final draft will count for the other 25%.     |W16|


As an instructor to all these new tech writers, my role felt a bit like _Senior Technical Writer_. I had to create all these assignments, teach them how to do well, schedule out the deadlines with enough time, provide detailed feedback after first submission, and in some instances revising, think aloud user-testing, and resubmitting of documents. 
Regarding Documentation: 
Assignment Guidelines:
Assignment Guideline documents that explain the required task

Grading Rubrics:
Grading rubrics that allow for more ethnical and consistent grading among sections and instructors
    - These should also be helpful for students in understanding requirements
The Nazarbayev University Writing Center already had rubrics and the director asked me to model mine off this genre. These rubrics also had to meet the grading descriptors of NU. This table is an example of the A category according to NU. Therefore, my grading descriptors needed to match this:

|Grade|%|Explanation|
|:----:| :----:| :--- |
|A|95-100|Excellent, exceeds the highest standards in the assignment or course|
|A-|90-94.9|Excellent; meets the highest standards for the assignment or course|
