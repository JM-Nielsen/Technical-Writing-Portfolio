<a name="introduction"></a> 
## Introduction
In 2018, I was asked to create a technical and professional writing course for engineers and computer scientists that satisfied all parties:
* The School of Sciences and Humanities
  * The Teaching and Learning Committee (TLC)
  * My Writing Center Director
* The School of Engineering and Digital Sciences
* Technical and professional writing theory
* Kazakhstani students
* [ABET](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/accreditation-criteria/criteria-for-accrediting-engineering-programs-2023-2024/) accreditation 

After a lot of reading of scholarly texts, interviewing SMEs, looking at other tech writing curricula, and conducting my own primary research, I settled on these **Learning Outcomes**:  
>1. Identify and understand the structures and functions of primary genres of technical writing.  
>2. Analyze and adapt to the constraints of specific rhetorical situations, including audiences, purposes, modality, and use.  
>3. Integrate tables, figures, and other images into documents.  
>4. Individually and collaboratively produce and present technical documents, including research reports, that are accessible to non-specialist audiences.  
>5. Demonstrate the ethical use of sources and appropriate citation conventions.  

Once approved, learning outcomes should not change unless approved again.

As an example, these outcomes specifically met the needs of:
* _ABET_ accreditation: requires ethnics and writing (**LO5**), 
* Chemistry students: required to write to non-specialist audiences (**LO4**), 
* Engineering faculty: wanted students to be able to better integrate tables and figures into documents (**LO3**), 
* Technical writing theory: informed students of the rhetorical situation (**LO2**), 
  * including audience, 
  * purposes, 
  * and genre.  

Therefore, these **LO**s worked well. 

**Course Summative Assessments** were then built to teach students these LOs. We decided we’d start small and work our way up to the larger assignments.

| Assignment                        | %    | Description                                   | Due   |   
| :---                              |:----:| :---                                          |:---   |
| Participation and Preparedness    | 10%  | Daily assessment may include: Writing tasks such as drafts, group discussions and workshops such as peer review, online assignments such as reading posts, quizzes, demonstrated preparedness for each class.                 |Cont.|
| Email and Memo                    | 10%  | Emails and Memos will be required within a specific rhetorical context  |W2, W9|
| Job Application Package           | 15% | An application package that includes a cover letter and resume. Students must create this package for a specific rhetorical situation.      |W4|
| Technical Instructions            | 15% |  Students must plan and write out a technical document, which describes a process they are familiar with. They will list out this process in no more than 12 steps using text and illustrations. The final (first) draft will count for 10%. The other 5% of this grade is for the revision writing process (second). (Collaborative)    |W6, W7|
| Usability Test and Presentation   | 15% |  Students must conduct a usability test on their technical instructions and create a digital presentation on the outcome (Collaborative).    |W7|
| IMRaDR Report                     | 35% |  Students will write reports on their field of interest and conduct the necessary primary research in the IMRaD genre (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) as well as provide recommendations on the issue/problem they choose. Recommend report front and back matter is also required. 10% of this grade is for the writing process: drafts, peer review, workshops, etc. The final draft will count for the other 25%.     |W16|

All assignments were devised using Bloom's taxonomy to cirriculum development, specifically working to meet as advanced learning outcomes as possible through Bloom's top levels: create, evaluate, and analyze. 

![Bloom's Taxonomy](https://citt.ufl.edu/media/cittufledu/images/Blooms-Taxonomy.png)


As Course Lead, I filled a similar roll to _Senior Technical Writer_. I created all course documentation, taught instructors to teach the course, conducted grading norming sessions to test for grading accuracy among professors, attended required Course Lead meetings, etc.

## Documentation

<a name="assignmentguidelines"></a>
### Assignment guidelines:

* Audience: Kazakhstani students
* Purpose: Inform students on how to complete the required task
* Genre: PDF file
* Exigency: Students need to understand the assignment in order to pass the class; Professors need proof of expected guidelines for grading and accuracy, consistent across sections. 


Assignment guidelines were constructed by me and reviewed by my peers. Each guideline was created to provide succinct background details on the genre as well as a superficial step-by-step guide. Because each instructor is allowed to deviate somewhat from the guidelines, they need to be written generally. 

Revisions: 

Every year assignment guidelines are revised to meet current expectations as well as student and instructor needs. For example, these documents used to include a checklist taken from _Technical Communication_ by Mike Markel, as well as more specific detail. Through in-class research (see: user testing), we noticed students didn’t use these sections, so they were removed.

**Example assignment guidelines:**

All other created assignment guidelines can be found in PDF format on [Google Drive.](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/12ILlYdfHhPdAJVm-YeQNv2BpJH-dM2LQ) You can also access all archived guidelines since they were initially created in 2019. 

<a name="gradingrubrics"></a>
### Grading rubrics:
Grading rubrics are used to make grading consistent, understandable, and precise among instructors and across sections. These rubrics had to meet NU grading descriptors and genre conventions. 

<a name="nugradingdescriptors"></a>
**NU grading descriptors:** NU requires instructors to follow their grading scheme. This table is an example of the A category according to NU:
|Grade|%|Explanation|
|:----:| :----:| :--- |
|A|95-100|Excellent, exceeds the highest standards in the assignment or course|
|A-|90-94.9|Excellent; meets the highest standards for the assignment or course|

<a name="genreconventions"></a>
**Genre conventions:** While I was tasked with creating rubrics from scratch for technical writing, an existing sample of this genre and it's conventions already existed in the Writing Center for lower level courses. I was asked to fit my new rubrics into this general format:  
|             | Excellent (A range) | Successful (B range) | Developing (C range) | Unsatisfactory (D and below) | Points |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|--------|
| Content (%) |                     |                      |                      |                              |        |
| Format (%)  |                     |                      |                      |                              |        |
| Grammar (%) |                     |                      |                      |                              |        |

_NOTE: Subsections of column 1 are open to change depending on the required tasks._ 

In order to make sure consistency exists between sections, I created this [Technical Writing Buzz Words document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IgRRroap_T2oNjAx2CWZKkTux3S1Ufsw/edit) based on _Technical Communication_ by Mike Markel that would help me describe quality in categories from A to D:


|  A   |   B  |  C   |  D   |
|---|---|---|---|
| highly, effective, masterful, expertly, sophisticated, excellent, very, really well, most, all, incredibly, fully, completely meticulously, strong.| This column mostly lacks modifiers. Simply fulfills guidelines.|lacks, somewhat, mostly, a lot, some many are not, don’t always, not always, doesn’t completely, attempted, basic standard, passable.|This column is mostly a negation of what it says in either column A or B|

<a name="thenewrubrics"></a>
#### The new rubrics:

I noticed a few issues with the old rubrics:
* Instructors weren’t using the Points column  
* The first column was taking up a lot of unnecessary space
* The document is text heavy
* The design does not complement the text

Using NU grading descriptors, Technical Writing Buzz Words, and my knowledge of the discipline, I created rubrics for each assignment—with a proper redesign based on what I noticed above.

**Updating old rubrics:** Below you can see examples of the original as we as how I adapted them to fit this class.

# Conclusion
This page illustrates my ability to write technically in unique situations while considering purpose, audience, and genre. What I've done here has and can be replicated in many other sphere's of technical writing.
