This document will do two things: showcases my ability to use Markdown and Github, breakdown the tech writing process to creating curriculum documentation.

## Introduction:
In 2018 I was asked to create a Technical and Professional Writing course for engineers and computer scientists that satisfied all parties:
* School of Sciences and Humanities
  * Teaching and learning committee
  * Writing Center Director
* School of Engineering and Digital Sciences
* Technical and professional writing theory
* Kazakhstani students
* [ABET](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/accreditation-criteria/criteria-for-accrediting-engineering-programs-2023-2024/) accreditation 

After a lot of reading of scholarly texts, interviewing SMEs, looking at other tech writing curricula, and conducting my own primary research, I settled on these **Learning Outcomes**:  
>1. Identify and understand the structures and functions of primary genres of technical writing.  
>2. Analyze and adapt to the constraints of specific rhetorical situations, including audiences, purposes, modality, and use.  
>3. Integrate tables, figures, and other images into documents.  
>4. Individually and collaboratively produce and present technical documents, including research reports, that are accessible to non-specialist audiences.  
>5. Demonstrate the ethical use of sources and appropriate citation conventions.  

Once these were approved by the Teaching and Learning Committee, they can't be change without further approval. Likewise, each assignment, assessments and policy needed to fit these outcomes.
* _ABET_ accreditation requires ethnics and writing (**LO5**), 
* chemistry students are required to write to non-specialist audiences (**LO4**), 
* engineering faculty wanted students to be able to better integrate tables and figures into documents (**LO3**), 
* and a lot of the technical writing theory is about the rhetorical situation (**LO2**), 
  * including audience, 
  * purposes, 
  * modality, 
  * and use.  

Therefore, these **LO**s worked well. 

We decided we’d start small and work our way up to the larger assignments. Here is all our **Course Summative Assessments**, what they are worth, a description, and when they are due. 

| Assignment                        | %    | Description                                   | Due   |   
| :---                              |:----:| :---                                          |:---   |
| Participation and Preparedness    | 10%  | Daily assessment may include: Writing tasks such as drafts, group discussions and workshops such as peer review, online assignments such as reading posts, quizzes, demonstrated preparedness for each class.                 |Cont.|
| Email and Memo                    | 10%  | Emails and Memos will be required within a specific rhetorical context  |W2, W9|
| Job Application Package           | 15% | An application package that includes a cover letter and resume. Students must create this package for a specific rhetorical situation.      |W4|
| Technical Instructions            | 15% |  Students must plan and write out a technical document, which describes a process they are familiar with. They will list out this process in no more than 12 steps using text and illustrations. The final (first) draft will count for 10%. The other 5% of this grade is for the revision writing process (second). (Collaborative)    |W6, W7|
| Usability Test and Presentation   | 15% |  Students must conduct a usability test on their technical instructions and create a digital presentation on the outcome (Collaborative).    |W7|
| IMRaDR Report                     | 35% |  Students will write reports on their field of interest and conduct the necessary primary research in the IMRaD genre (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) as well as provide recommendations on the issue/problem they choose. Recommend report front and back matter is also required. 10% of this grade is for the writing process: drafts, peer review, workshops, etc. The final draft will count for the other 25%.     |W16|


As an instructor to all these new tech writers, my role felt a bit like _Senior Technical Writer_. I had to create all these assignments, teach them how to do well, schedule out the deadlines with enough time, provide detailed feedback after first submission, and in some instances revising, think aloud user-testing, and resubmitting of documents. 
## Documentation: 
### Assignment Guidelines:
Assignment Guideline documents that explain the required task (Explain)

### Grading Rubrics:
Grading rubrics are used to make grading consistent, understandable, and precise among instructors and courses. These rubrics had to meet the grading descriptors of NU. This table is an example of the A category according to NU:
|Grade|%|Explanation|
|:----:| :----:| :--- |
|A|95-100|Excellent, exceeds the highest standards in the assignment or course|
|A-|90-94.9|Excellent; meets the highest standards for the assignment or course|

Likewise, an existing sample of this genre and it's conventions already existed in the Writing Center. I was asked to fit my new rubrics into this general style.   

Previous Rubric Needed Work:   
>Instructors weren’t using the notes column(image here)   
>The first title column was taking up a lot of unnecessary space(image here)  
>The document is bloated with information, which makes things feel squished(image here)  (Make all this in Illustrator? as a single doc?)

In order to make sure there is consistency between sections, I came up with a [Technical Writing Buzz Words document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IgRRroap_T2oNjAx2CWZKkTux3S1Ufsw/edit) based on _Technical Communication_ by Mike Markel that would help me describe quality in categories from A to D:

|  A   |   B  |  C   |  D   |
|---|---|---|---|
| highly, effective, masterful, expertly, sophisticated, excellent, very, really well, most, all, incredibly, fully, completely meticulously, strong.| This column mostly lacks modifiers. Simply fulfills guidelines.|lacks, somewhat, mostly, a lot, some many are not, don’t always, not always, doesn’t completely, attempted, basic standard, passable.|This column is mostly a negation of what it says in either column A or B|

#### The New Rubrics:
Using NU grading descriptors, Technical Writing Buzz Words, and my knowledge of the discipline, I created rubrics for each assignment—with a proper redesign: (Imbed the table into the document?)
